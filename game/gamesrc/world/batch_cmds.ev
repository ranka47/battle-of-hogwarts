@teleport Limbo

#inside Limbo

@desc 19 years have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts. Many changes have come into picture not only at Hogwarts but in the Ministry of Magic too. Some liked it AND SOME DIDN'T. It is indeed to keep the balance on the earth between the Good and the Evil; both must exist. 
The Dementors were removed from the Azkaban and sent to an isolation place as they had helped Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. They found out regarding the Elder Wand and also that it has been kept in front of the portrait of Professor Albus  Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Wanting revenge against the awful behaviour of the Wizardry World towards them they blamed Harry Potter for all this. So in the advent of stealing the Wand from the Hogwarts they also kidnapped his son Albus Severus Potter. In the process of saving him, Scorpius Malfoy (the son of Draco Malfoy) goes after the Dementors but is eventually caught. Now taking Gilderoy Lockhart as their decoy they cast Memory Charms at many Wizards and take them into their possession. Many beasts have turned against the Ministry on the fear of the Dementor’s Kiss as it sucks the soul. 

Now Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy one times biggest rivals have teamed up to save their sons and ultimately the world. On their journey they used to get caught many times by the Dementors but they succeeded in escaping. Now they are on their way to the Shriecking Shack where their sons have been kept.

You apparate in front of a snowy white building that towers over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze DOORS to your NORTH, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold. There is also a road coming from EAST and going to the WEST for the shops of the Diagon Alley.
You recall memories of Ollivanders Wand Shop to the East and The Broomstix to the West. It had been so much fun in the Diagon Alley but today it seems haunted.

They entered the Inn and stood behind the counter. Harry greets him and introduces Draco to Aberforth Dumbledore, the brother of Albus Dumbledore. Draco sees a broken mirror in the room which Sirius Black had gifted Harry. You could find a kitchen and besides to it goes down a staircase towards East. 
Harry informs him that they need to get to the Hogwarts. To which he replies that they must have the Marauder’s Map (Map tells you who is where in Hogwarts Castle but you can't see Room of Requirement, the Chamber of Secret and the Shrieking Shack). Harry agrees and informs him that it had been with his son James Sirius Potter, he had hidden it somewhere in Hogsmeade but couldn’t convey the location.

Draco and Harry discussed about getting into the Hogwarts through the secret passage leading them into the Room of Requirement. Aberforth helped them with some snacks. Snacks gave them a thought - “{wBetter we were hungry{n.”
After that Aberforth explains them to learn the spells with new incantation so as to defeat the Dementors and others. Moreover he also informs that only few teachers in Hogwarts know the ancient incantations of the spells. 
He asks them to come to an empty room to their left to learn the spell.

#inside room018

@desc On the inquiry of Draco, Aberforth answered that he know just two spells to cast with ancient Incantation. One being the Patronus Charm and the Disarming Charm. 
However learning ancient incantation is not easy. On learning this spells all students have to make The Unbreakable Vow (which if broken leads to immediate death) that 
they won't tell anyone the incantation directly. The Caster has to get the Incantation by going through a test of any form.
That is the reason they can't be ever tabooed as the beasts can never know what they are because they can't make Unbreakable Vow.

Disarming Charm - Causes whatever the victim is holding to fly away, knocks down the opponent if used forcefully. 
YP IDR YJR D[R;; DSU 
{wRC[R;;P ST,S{n

Patronus Charm - It is defensive spell which will take form a Patronus (it is an animal form which would depict your character precisely) from all your positive emotions’ energy. Can be used against Lethifolds and Dementors. 
YP IDR YJR D[R;; DSU
{wRC[RVYP [SYTPMID{n

Muggle’s (one who don't know magic) world has an instrument named Keyboard. It could be of great help to you two to learn the spell.

After learning the spells, Aberforth asks them to come back to the Sitting Room as Ariana was ready to open the secret passage.
